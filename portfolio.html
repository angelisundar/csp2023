    <br>
    <h1>   The game we created is a very universal game of Tic Tac Toe but with a Minions theme. You will either be using an O or an X against one of your friends. Click on the square you want to place your shape.  Be competitive and have fun! We met the requirements by creating loops for the X's/O's and animated the drawing board.</h1>

    <br>
    <h1>   The game created was a spin off of Crossy Road. The objective is to use the arrow keys to guide the minion through the game avoiding the cars to get to the bananas. We met the requirements by having a timer and a message pop up at the end to say if you lost or won. We also had strings in the code for collisions with the cars. </h1>

The objective is to get the horse/hare to the diamond blocks and you can see the level counter and death counter in the upper left hand corner.
